		<h3>Old Statement of Faith on Eschatology from a few years ago</h3>
		<p>
I believe that there are two Sacraments in the Bible, the Lord’s Supper and Baptism. The Sacraments are a sign from the Holy Spirit of salvation in Christ and are administered by the Church. The Sacraments are public and together with the whole body of Christ. I believe that there are only two because both are directly commanded by Christ to his followers(Matt. 28:19, Matt. 26:26-29). I believe that only believers are allowed to partake in the Sacraments because they are outward signs of faith in the Lord.
I believe that both sinners and unbelievers can attend church, but should not be allowed to partake in the sacraments. I believe this because I believe that they should be able to observe and listen to what God has given to us. I believe that the Church has a structure laid out, composed of bishops, deacons, elders, and a presbytery(Phil.1:1, Acts 20:17, 1 Tim.4:14). I believe that there is a set blueprint for leadership because of the mentioning of specific positions in the Bible, such as elders, deacons, and bishops.
I believe that when people come together in Christ’s name to worship him, the church is there, no matter how many or how few(Rom.16:5, Matt.18:19). I believe that the Church Universal is made up of all believers, fellow members of the Body of Christ.
