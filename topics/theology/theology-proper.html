		<h3>Old Statement of Faith on Theology Proper from a few years ago</h3>
		<p>
I believe in an all knowing(Omniscience), all powerful(Omnipotent), and ever present(Omnipresent) God the Father(Psalm 147:4-5, Psalm 33:6, Acts 17:24, Jeremiah 23:23-24). I believe that humans cannot fully comprehend the Father(Job 5:9, Romans 11:33–34, 1 Corinthians 2:16). I believe that God the Father is Spirit and a specific person of the Godhead because the Bible references to the Father when he is speaking as “us” and “I” in Genesis 1:26, Genesis 3:22, and Exodus 3:14. I believe that God is all knowing but doesn’t know the future because the future has not happened yet, therefore I also believe that the future is unknowable, maintaining an all knowing God because he knows everything that there is to be known. I also believe that God can predict the future with great accuracy because he can see into all motives of man, and also can see every factor at play at once, giving him precision and accuracy in his knowledge of the future. I also believe that the future is unknowable because God has given man free will, and if  he is able know the future, it would violate our free will. For instance, if it is written ahead of time that certain people are going to be saved, then the cross wouldn’t be a sacrifice for all people, but the select that were designated ahead of time. Therefore, I also believe that God experiences time as we do and isn’t present at all points of time at the same time because he would need to exist in the future, which currently doesn’t exist. I believe that God can change, allowing him to feel emotions, and have experienced death on the cross for the first time. I believe that because God experienced death for the first time, he had made the single sacrifice to wash away all of man’s sins and allowed him to develop a closer relationship with a redeemed humanity. Also, I believe God feels emotions, because is seen through both the creation of man in his image, revealed by our experiences of emotions, and through the Bible explaining that he is a God full of joy, jealousy, anger, love, compassion, and grief(Romans 1:18,  Deuteronomy 32:36, 1 John 4:8,  Proverbs 6:16, Exodus 20:5, Zephaniah 3:17).
