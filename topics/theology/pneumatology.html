		<h2>Study of the Holy Spirit</h2>
		<h3>Old Statement of Faith on Pneumatology from a few years ago</h3>
		<p>
I believe in the Holy Spirit. I believe that the Holy Spirit is one person of the Holy Spirit and fully God. I believe that all of Scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit(2 Peter 1:20-21). I believe that the Holy Spirit is all knowing(1 Cor 2:10-11). I believe that the Holy Spirit comes from the Father(προϊέναι) but proceeds from Christ(ἐκπορεύεσθαι). I believe this because there are two different verbs used in explaining the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Father and the Holy Spirit and the Son, because there are different verbs being used, I believe that the Spirit has a generative relationship with the Father that is not present with the Son. I believe that the Holy Spirit moves the hearts of man, like a wind, giving life and bringing them to faith(John 3:8). I also believe that the Spirit is like water, bringing blessings and life where it reaches(Isa 12:3; 44:3; Zech 14:16-18). I also believe that the Spirit purifies like holy fire, preparing a people for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ(Titus 2:11-14, Luke 3:16). I believe that the Holy Spirit has inspired the written word of God, as seen in Ezekiel 2:2, 2 Tim 3:16. I believe that the Spirit guides, teaches, intercedes, leads, and sanctifies the believer(John 14:26, Romans 8:26-27, Galatians 5:25, Luke 3:16).
