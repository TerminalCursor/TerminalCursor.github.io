		<h3>Old Statement of Faith on Anthropology from a few years ago</h3>
		<p>
I believe that man has been created in the image of God(Genesis 1:27). I believe that we are set apart in creation because we are the only created thing to bear the imago dei. I believe that the image of God involves our capabilities of being relational with both each other and God. I believe that this is demonstrated in our capacity to feel empathy, and different emotions. From our capacity to convey our emotions, we are able to have a deeper relationship with other people, and most importantly our creator. I believe that we are created with a purpose, to care for the world(Genesis 1:28).
I believe that we are created with both a body and soul. I believe that we are bipartite because God formed man with dirt then breathed the breath of life in him. Also, 1 Kings 17:21-22, Elijah prays over a dead boy’s body to God to restore his breath, נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh), to him. God then restored the child’s nephesh and the boy once again lived. I believe that this reveals that the soul and body are two separate parts to the whole makeup of man. Another reason is that in Genesis 2:7 and similarly in Ezekiel 37:6, it portrays man being created with two parts, the flesh and the breath. The wording between the two verses use the same language of body and breath being put into the creation of man separately. Jesus even taught that the soul and body are separate in Matthew 10:28 when he tells us not to be afraid of the people who kill the body, because they cannot kill the soul, but to be afraid of the one, who can destroy both in Hell. I believe that because of the places in the bible where it portrays a distinction between the body and the soul, that man is bipartite. I also believe that both parts make up the whole of the human being, that both parts are involved in everything that the person does.
