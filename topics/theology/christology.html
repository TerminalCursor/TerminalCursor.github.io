		<h2>Study of Christ and his work</h2>
		<h3>Old Statement of Faith on Christology from a few years ago</h3>
		<p>
I believe that Jesus is fully God and fully human (John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:9).I believe that the Father and the Son are united in being, but separate in function. I believe that Christ is another member of the trinity, and he is coequal and coeternal with both the Father and the Spirit. I believe that Christ became both fully human and fully God at the same time because if Christ was not fully human, he would not be able to be a sacrifice for our sins, and if he was not fully God, he would not be able to be a perfect sacrifice for the sin of the world. I believe that he was fully deity while he was human because of the miracles he performed, and the claims he made to being equal with the Father(Matthew 9:6-8, Mark 6:31-44, John 2:1-11, 5:18, 8:19, 13:20).  I believe that Jesus existed as the Logos before he was incarnated (John 1:1-2). I believe that Jesus is at the right hand of God presently(Hebrews 1:3, 12:2).
I believe that Christ was incarnated in man, but he didn’t surrender his divinity while doing so. I believe that Christ was sinless. I believe that he is sinless because of his virgin birth, maintaining an unbroken relationship with God the Father. Historically the child’s sin nature is derived from the father of the child, and since God is the father of Christ, he was born without a broken relationship with God. Also, because he was born of a human mother, he is fully human.
I believe that Christ was the perfect sacrifice because he was fully human, and because he was without sin. I believe that Jesus is our high priest and he is not of the same priesthood of Aaron, but of Melchizedek, meaning that his priesthood doesn’t require a continuous sacrifice to wash away sins, but he is the perfect lamb, wiping all sins with a single sacrifice(Hebrews 10:14). I believe that Christ is also King, ruling over all creation(Revelation 11:15). I believe that Christ’s sacrifice was for all of the sins of the world, but only covers the sins of believers. I believe that his sacrifice was the full payment for the punishment that a guilty sinner deserves and restoring the perfect relationship between God and the believer.
