		<h2>Study of Sin and its nature</h2>
		<h3>Old Statement of Faith on Hamartiology from a few years ago</h3>
		<p>
I believe that all of humanity has sinned. I believe that sin is defined as a broken relationship with God from our inability to keep his commandments because of our rebellious nature(1 John 3:4, Deuteronomy 9:7, Joshua 1:18). I believe that all people bear the consequence and the guilt of Adam and Eve’s sin. Romans 5:12 states, “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men”. This clearly paints Adam and Eve’s sin as being an inherited sin that no human can avoid.
I believe that we have been given a free will, and because of our free will, we are able to sin on our own accord, but I also believe that because of the fall, our free will tends to make choices that rebel against what God has said. I believe that because of our sin nature we experience a physical death, God’s wrath, and spiritual death(Genesis 3:8-10, Romans 6:23, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22). I believe that because we have sinned we are unable to renew the relationship we had with God without God’s divine grace and salvation.

		<h3>Old Statement of Faith from an Old Pastor</h3>
		<p>
I believe that Jesus Christ pured out Himself to death as the substitutionary atonement for the sins of the world, paying the penalty for their sin, which fulfilled the demands of God's righteousness, and His desire for mercy (Is 53:4-6; Rom 3:23-25; 8:3; I Pet 2:24). This atonement has made provision in general for the sins of all mankind, and yet is made efficacious in particular for the elect, those believing (John 3:16; I Tim 4:10; I Jn 2:2). The sacrificial death of Christ fully propitiated the wrath of God, turning away His rightful anger against a guilty offender (I Jn 2:2; 4:10; Rom 3:25). His death has provided the expiation of sin, removing the liability for punishment from sinful men (Heb 10:10; 13:11-12). It has provided for redemption, ransoming souls from slavery to sin (Titus 2:14; I Pet 1:18-19) and for the reconciliation of those believing, a restoration of the purposed relationship between God and men (II Cor 5:18-20; Rom 5:8-11).
