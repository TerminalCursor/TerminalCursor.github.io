		<h3>Old Statement of Faith on Eschatology from a few years ago</h3>
		<p>
I believe that when the millennium is referred to, it is not a literal thousand years but a time period of Christ’s reign in the world. I believe this because it is in a context that uses the largeness of the number to convey a long lasting reign of Christ in the world to the reader, just as this kind of language is used to talk about the thousand generations that has kept God’s word(Deuteronomy 7:8-9). I believe that Christ will reign on his heavenly throne through the spreading of his gospel on earth. From this gradual spreading, comes a growing believers of Christ in the world, up until all peoples on earth are blessed, as promised to Abraham(Genesis 12:1-3).
I believe that right at the end of this time period, Christ will descend to the earth and the world’s judgment will begin. I believe that the righteous and wicked will be risen from the grave, and will also be judged when Christ returns. I believe this will happen accordingly because that would mean that he will clear the impurities of the world as he returns, rather than reigning in an impure world, then judging it.
I believe that this gradual Christianization is also supported by images of a slow conversion from Scripture(Deuteronomy 7:22, Ezekiel 47:1-1). I believe that most of the prophecies in Revelations have already been fulfilled by the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem.
