		<h3>Study of the essence, being, and trinity of God</h3>
		<h4>Old Statement of Faith on Theology Proper from a few years ago</h4>
		<p>
I believe in an all knowing(Omniscience), all powerful(Omnipotent), and ever present(Omnipresent) God the Father(Psalm 147:4-5, Psalm 33:6, Acts 17:24, Jeremiah 23:23-24). I believe that humans cannot fully comprehend the Father(Job 5:9, Romans 11:33–34, 1 Corinthians 2:16). I believe that God the Father is Spirit and a specific person of the Godhead because the Bible references to the Father when he is speaking as “us” and “I” in Genesis 1:26, Genesis 3:22, and Exodus 3:14. I believe that God is all knowing but doesn’t know the future because the future has not happened yet, therefore I also believe that the future is unknowable, maintaining an all knowing God because he knows everything that there is to be known. I also believe that God can predict the future with great accuracy because he can see into all motives of man, and also can see every factor at play at once, giving him precision and accuracy in his knowledge of the future. I also believe that the future is unknowable because God has given man free will, and if  he is able know the future, it would violate our free will. For instance, if it is written ahead of time that certain people are going to be saved, then the cross wouldn’t be a sacrifice for all people, but the select that were designated ahead of time. Therefore, I also believe that God experiences time as we do and isn’t present at all points of time at the same time because he would need to exist in the future, which currently doesn’t exist. I believe that God can change, allowing him to feel emotions, and have experienced death on the cross for the first time. I believe that because God experienced death for the first time, he had made the single sacrifice to wash away all of man’s sins and allowed him to develop a closer relationship with a redeemed humanity. Also, I believe God feels emotions, because is seen through both the creation of man in his image, revealed by our experiences of emotions, and through the Bible explaining that he is a God full of joy, jealousy, anger, love, compassion, and grief(Romans 1:18,  Deuteronomy 32:36, 1 John 4:8,  Proverbs 6:16, Exodus 20:5, Zephaniah 3:17).

		<h3>Study of Christ and his work</h3>
		<h4>Old Statement of Faith on Christology from a few years ago</h4>
		<p>
I believe that Jesus is fully God and fully human (John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:9).I believe that the Father and the Son are united in being, but separate in function. I believe that Christ is another member of the trinity, and he is coequal and coeternal with both the Father and the Spirit. I believe that Christ became both fully human and fully God at the same time because if Christ was not fully human, he would not be able to be a sacrifice for our sins, and if he was not fully God, he would not be able to be a perfect sacrifice for the sin of the world. I believe that he was fully deity while he was human because of the miracles he performed, and the claims he made to being equal with the Father(Matthew 9:6-8, Mark 6:31-44, John 2:1-11, 5:18, 8:19, 13:20).  I believe that Jesus existed as the Logos before he was incarnated (John 1:1-2). I believe that Jesus is at the right hand of God presently(Hebrews 1:3, 12:2).
I believe that Christ was incarnated in man, but he didn’t surrender his divinity while doing so. I believe that Christ was sinless. I believe that he is sinless because of his virgin birth, maintaining an unbroken relationship with God the Father. Historically the child’s sin nature is derived from the father of the child, and since God is the father of Christ, he was born without a broken relationship with God. Also, because he was born of a human mother, he is fully human.
I believe that Christ was the perfect sacrifice because he was fully human, and because he was without sin. I believe that Jesus is our high priest and he is not of the same priesthood of Aaron, but of Melchizedek, meaning that his priesthood doesn’t require a continuous sacrifice to wash away sins, but he is the perfect lamb, wiping all sins with a single sacrifice(Hebrews 10:14). I believe that Christ is also King, ruling over all creation(Revelation 11:15). I believe that Christ’s sacrifice was for all of the sins of the world, but only covers the sins of believers. I believe that his sacrifice was the full payment for the punishment that a guilty sinner deserves and restoring the perfect relationship between God and the believer.

		<h3>Study of the Holy Spirit</h3>
		<h4>Old Statement of Faith on Pneumatology from a few years ago</h4>
		<p>
I believe in the Holy Spirit. I believe that the Holy Spirit is one person of the Holy Spirit and fully God. I believe that all of Scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit(2 Peter 1:20-21). I believe that the Holy Spirit is all knowing(1 Cor 2:10-11). I believe that the Holy Spirit comes from the Father(προϊέναι) but proceeds from Christ(ἐκπορεύεσθαι). I believe this because there are two different verbs used in explaining the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Father and the Holy Spirit and the Son, because there are different verbs being used, I believe that the Spirit has a generative relationship with the Father that is not present with the Son. I believe that the Holy Spirit moves the hearts of man, like a wind, giving life and bringing them to faith(John 3:8). I also believe that the Spirit is like water, bringing blessings and life where it reaches(Isa 12:3; 44:3; Zech 14:16-18). I also believe that the Spirit purifies like holy fire, preparing a people for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ(Titus 2:11-14, Luke 3:16). I believe that the Holy Spirit has inspired the written word of God, as seen in Ezekiel 2:2, 2 Tim 3:16. I believe that the Spirit guides, teaches, intercedes, leads, and sanctifies the believer(John 14:26, Romans 8:26-27, Galatians 5:25, Luke 3:16).

		<h3>Study of Man-creation, innocence, and The Fall</h3>
		<h4>Old Statement of Faith on Anthropology from a few years ago</h4>
		<p>
I believe that man has been created in the image of God(Genesis 1:27). I believe that we are set apart in creation because we are the only created thing to bear the imago dei. I believe that the image of God involves our capabilities of being relational with both each other and God. I believe that this is demonstrated in our capacity to feel empathy, and different emotions. From our capacity to convey our emotions, we are able to have a deeper relationship with other people, and most importantly our creator. I believe that we are created with a purpose, to care for the world(Genesis 1:28).
I believe that we are created with both a body and soul. I believe that we are bipartite because God formed man with dirt then breathed the breath of life in him. Also, 1 Kings 17:21-22, Elijah prays over a dead boy’s body to God to restore his breath, נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh), to him. God then restored the child’s nephesh and the boy once again lived. I believe that this reveals that the soul and body are two separate parts to the whole makeup of man. Another reason is that in Genesis 2:7 and similarly in Ezekiel 37:6, it portrays man being created with two parts, the flesh and the breath. The wording between the two verses use the same language of body and breath being put into the creation of man separately. Jesus even taught that the soul and body are separate in Matthew 10:28 when he tells us not to be afraid of the people who kill the body, because they cannot kill the soul, but to be afraid of the one, who can destroy both in Hell. I believe that because of the places in the bible where it portrays a distinction between the body and the soul, that man is bipartite. I also believe that both parts make up the whole of the human being, that both parts are involved in everything that the person does.

		<h3>Study of Sin and its nature</h3>
		<h4>Old Statement of Faith on Hamartiology from a few years ago</h4>
		<p>
I believe that all of humanity has sinned. I believe that sin is defined as a broken relationship with God from our inability to keep his commandments because of our rebellious nature(1 John 3:4, Deuteronomy 9:7, Joshua 1:18). I believe that all people bear the consequence and the guilt of Adam and Eve’s sin. Romans 5:12 states, “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men”. This clearly paints Adam and Eve’s sin as being an inherited sin that no human can avoid.
I believe that we have been given a free will, and because of our free will, we are able to sin on our own accord, but I also believe that because of the fall, our free will tends to make choices that rebel against what God has said. I believe that because of our sin nature we experience a physical death, God’s wrath, and spiritual death(Genesis 3:8-10, Romans 6:23, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22). I believe that because we have sinned we are unable to renew the relationship we had with God without God’s divine grace and salvation.

		<h4>Old Statement of Faith from an Old Pastor</h4>
		<p>
I believe that Jesus Christ pured out Himself to death as the substitutionary atonement for the sins of the world, paying the penalty for their sin, which fulfilled the demands of God's righteousness, and His desire for mercy (Is 53:4-6; Rom 3:23-25; 8:3; I Pet 2:24). This atonement has made provision in general for the sins of all mankind, and yet is made efficacious in particular for the elect, those believing (John 3:16; I Tim 4:10; I Jn 2:2). The sacrificial death of Christ fully propitiated the wrath of God, turning away His rightful anger against a guilty offender (I Jn 2:2; 4:10; Rom 3:25). His death has provided the expiation of sin, removing the liability for punishment from sinful men (Heb 10:10; 13:11-12). It has provided for redemption, ransoming souls from slavery to sin (Titus 2:14; I Pet 1:18-19) and for the reconciliation of those believing, a restoration of the purposed relationship between God and men (II Cor 5:18-20; Rom 5:8-11).

		<h3>Study of the Church (Universal as well as Local)</h3>
		<h4>Old Statement of Faith on Eschatology from a few years ago</h4>
		<p>
I believe that there are two Sacraments in the Bible, the Lord’s Supper and Baptism. The Sacraments are a sign from the Holy Spirit of salvation in Christ and are administered by the Church. The Sacraments are public and together with the whole body of Christ. I believe that there are only two because both are directly commanded by Christ to his followers(Matt. 28:19, Matt. 26:26-29). I believe that only believers are allowed to partake in the Sacraments because they are outward signs of faith in the Lord.
I believe that both sinners and unbelievers can attend church, but should not be allowed to partake in the sacraments. I believe this because I believe that they should be able to observe and listen to what God has given to us. I believe that the Church has a structure laid out, composed of bishops, deacons, elders, and a presbytery(Phil.1:1, Acts 20:17, 1 Tim.4:14). I believe that there is a set blueprint for leadership because of the mentioning of specific positions in the Bible, such as elders, deacons, and bishops.
I believe that when people come together in Christ’s name to worship him, the church is there, no matter how many or how few(Rom.16:5, Matt.18:19). I believe that the Church Universal is made up of all believers, fellow members of the Body of Christ.

		<h3>Study of Last Things</h3>
		<h4>Old Statement of Faith on Eschatology from a few years ago</h4>
		<p>
I believe that when the millennium is referred to, it is not a literal thousand years but a time period of Christ’s reign in the world. I believe this because it is in a context that uses the largeness of the number to convey a long lasting reign of Christ in the world to the reader, just as this kind of language is used to talk about the thousand generations that has kept God’s word(Deuteronomy 7:8-9). I believe that Christ will reign on his heavenly throne through the spreading of his gospel on earth. From this gradual spreading, comes a growing believers of Christ in the world, up until all peoples on earth are blessed, as promised to Abraham(Genesis 12:1-3).
I believe that right at the end of this time period, Christ will descend to the earth and the world’s judgment will begin. I believe that the righteous and wicked will be risen from the grave, and will also be judged when Christ returns. I believe this will happen accordingly because that would mean that he will clear the impurities of the world as he returns, rather than reigning in an impure world, then judging it.
I believe that this gradual Christianization is also supported by images of a slow conversion from Scripture(Deuteronomy 7:22, Ezekiel 47:1-1). I believe that most of the prophecies in Revelations have already been fulfilled by the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem.
