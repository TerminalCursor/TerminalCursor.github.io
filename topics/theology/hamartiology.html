		<h2>Study of Sin and its nature</h2>
		<h3>Old Statement of Faith from an Old Pastor</h3>
		<p>
I believe that Jesus Christ pured out Himself to death as the substitutionary atonement for the sins of the world, paying the penalty for their sin, which fulfilled the demands of God's righteousness, and His desire for mercy (Is 53:4-6; Rom 3:23-25; 8:3; I Pet 2:24). This atonement has made provision in general for the sins of all mankind, and yet is made efficacious in particular for the elect, those believing (John 3:16; I Tim 4:10; I Jn 2:2). The sacrificial death of Christ fully propitiated the wrath of God, turning away His rightful anger against a guilty offender (I Jn 2:2; 4:10; Rom 3:25). His death has provided the expiation of sin, removing the liability for punishment from sinful men (Heb 10:10; 13:11-12). It has provided for redemption, ransoming souls from slavery to sin (Titus 2:14; I Pet 1:18-19) and for the reconciliation of those believing, a restoration of the purposed relationship between God and men (II Cor 5:18-20; Rom 5:8-11).
