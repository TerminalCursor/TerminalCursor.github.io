				I have completely purged this site of all JavaScript. This should enable full functionality with CLI browsers. Additionally, I have created my own script to run to configure my Gentoo system up to the chroot environment. I will later add chroot.sh and post-chroot.sh to sequentially rice the Gentoo system to a complete FVWM enabled environment automatically. So far, the pre-chroot is working exactly as intended.

				I have updated my website's navigation and removed links to JS enabled pages. I will attempt to recreate the utilities in another language other than JavaScript and distribute them on my Github since I think that JavaScript opens up more security holes than has benefits.

				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				Welcome to my website. I have designed it (barring the Uncertainty Propogation Calculator that uses JS) so that it can be viewed in any browser, even a CLI browser.
