    <description>I have completely purged this site of all JavaScript. This should enable full functionality with CLI browsers. Additionally, I have created my own script to run to configure my Gentoo system up to the chroot environment. I will later add chroot.sh and post-chroot.sh to sequentially rice the Gentoo system to a complete FVWM enabled environment automatically. So far, the pre-chroot is working exactly as intended.</description>
