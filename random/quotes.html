        <p><b>These quotes I do not necessarily believe, but I at least think they have something worth considering/ reflecting upon.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you.
            </i><br/>
            - C.S. Lewis
        </p>
        <p><i>
            Do not wonder that I am so religious. An artist who is not could not produce anything like this. I like praying there at the window when I look out on the green and at the sky. I study with the birds, flowers, God and myself.
            </i><br/>
            - Antonin Dvorak
        </p>
        <p><i>
            Charity is of God, is love, is the fountain and source of all goodness and mercy, infinitely good in himself, and in his love and mercy towards mankind.
            </i><br/>
            - George Leo Haydock
        </p>
        <p><i>
            Therefore I shall ask God mercifully to protect us.
            Then I shall fumigate, help purify the air, administer medicine, and take it.
            I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance infect and pollute others, and so cause their death as a result of my negligence.
            <br/>
            If God should wish to take me, he will surely find me, and I have done what he has expected of me and so I am not responsible for either my own death or the death of others.
            If my neighbor needs me, however, I shall not avoid place or person but will go freely, as stated above.
            See, this is such a God-fearing faith because it is neither brash nor foolhardy and does not tempt God.
            </i><br/>
            - Martin Luther
        </p>
        <p><i>
            My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust.
            But how had I got this idea of just and unjust?
            A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line.
            What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust?
            </i><br/>
            - C.S. Lewis
        </p>
        <p><i>
            It is more important to have beauty in one's equation than to have them fit experiment.
            </i><br/>
            - Dirac
        </p>
